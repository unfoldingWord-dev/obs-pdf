# .travis.yml
#
# Requires the following environment variables to be set in the Travis settings:
#   DOCKER_USERNAME
#   DOCKER_PASSWORD

dist: bionic
language: python
# See available versions at https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/python/
python:
  - '3.8'
  # - 'nightly'
# NOTE: We only deploy on ONE of these tests being successful -- see condition below

services:
  - docker

#before_install:
  #- pip install awscli
  #- scripts/travis_install_apex.sh

install:
  - pip3 install --upgrade pip
  - pip3 install --requirement requirements.txt
  # - pip3 install coveralls
  # - pip3 install mypy

# Run the tests first
#  and if they succeed, make the docker image(s)
#   (and check that both succeed)
script:
  - ls
  # - mypy enqueue/
  # - PYTHONPATH="enqueue/" coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests/

# Only execute the following instructions in the case of a success
#  (failing at this point won't mark the build as a failure).
# To have `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` filled
#  you need to either use `travis`' cli and then `travis set ..`
#  or go to the travis page of your repository
#  and then change the environment in the settings pannel.
# after_success:
#   - coveralls
